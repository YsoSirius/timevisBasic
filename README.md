# timevis-basic

A very basic htmlwidgets implementation of a timeline widget (provided by the vis.js library). This basic implementation is used as the starting point for my tutorial on how to add useful features to an htmlwidget available at [TODO]


```
data <- list(list(content = "today", start = Sys.Date()),
           list(content = "tomorrow", start = Sys.Date() + 1))
```
